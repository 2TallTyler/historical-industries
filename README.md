# Improved Town Industries

## Coming soon!

## Principles

* Processing industries spawn near cities
* Most industries accept passengers as workers
* Industries have realistic introduction dates for gameplay as early as 1700
* Primary industry production is controlled by vanilla production mechanics, but delivering boost products (passengers or chemicals) improves the odds of an increase
