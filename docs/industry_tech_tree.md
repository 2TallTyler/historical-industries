# Funded Industry Tech Tree
Improved Town Industries has a parameter, "Generate Primary Industries Only," which disables automatic generation of secondary industries, requiring the player to fund them instead. This adds an additional challenge to your gameplay.

There is a intended tech tree of industries and cargos, and both cargo delivery prices and industry funding costs are set accordingly. On default settings, Tier 1 processing industries should be affordable with the initial loan but you'll need to save up for more expensive industries. Each tech level is around twice as expensive as the previous level, but you'll gain access to more profitable cargos.

## Secondary Industries

Tier 1:
- Sawmill
- Recycling Center
- Power Plant

Tier 2:
- Factory

Tier 3:
- Paper Mill
- Steel Mill

Tier 4:
- Oil Refinery

Tier 5:
- Nuclear Fuel Plant

## Primary Industries
To build primary industries, the game setting "Manual primary industry construction method" must be set to "Prospecting" or "As other industries".

Like secondary industries, each tech level is approximately twice as expensive as the previous, but the cargos are more valuable.

Note: When building primary industries "as other industries," the cost is 4x as expensive as prospecting. This is a base OpenTTD mechanic. 

Tier 1:
- Forest

Tier 2:
- Farm
 
Tier 3:
- Coal Mine
- Iron Mine

Tier 4:
- Oil Wells

Tier 5:
